# How to Use This Question Pool

- For **Theoretical Knowledge (15 marks)** and **Conceptual Understanding (20 marks)**, select multiple questions or combine short and long answers to cover the breadth and depth.  
- For smaller weighted sections, 3-5 questions per section are sufficient.  
- Mix objective questions (MCQs, true/false) with descriptive and scenario-based questions for a balanced assessment.  
- Use code snippets or diagrams where applicable to test practical understanding.
